Information

My first project in WDI is an app that makes the translation of commonly used words and phrases to be easily accessible.

User will be able to modify their own lists and phrases and request an admin to translate additional phrases for them.

Admin will be able to change any lists and phrases.

This app is useful for someone learning specific phrases in a certain subject, or to use in practice to communicate with someone speaking Chinese at work. (In this example, for an optometry practice)
